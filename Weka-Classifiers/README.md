# Weka Classifiers

This program will predict the class values of a given test set by using the provided training
and preliminary test data. To do this, it will utilize the Weka library and train five of
its classifiers (attribute selected classifier, bagging, random committee, random sub space,
and random forest) to all be used together to predict the class values.

This program will output: An approximate accuracy of the predictions

The class definition for **Attribute** is also provided here. The **Attribute** class maintains
information related to one particular attribute, including its name and whether it is continuous
(with its start and end values) or discrete (with its list of values).
