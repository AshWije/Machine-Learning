# Machine Learning From Scratch And Weka

This repository includes the implementation of four different machine learning algorithms:
Bayesian Learning, Decision Tree, Markov Decision Process, and Neural Network.

It also includes a combination of Weka classifiers that resulted in excellent results
on a given training set.

This is done in order to better understand the different algorithms and the Weka library.
